    "\n",
    "An unsupervised learning algorithm which means you take unlabelled data and put them in clusters (based on their characteristics) as name suggests. \n",
    "Data or objects similar in characteristics or nature are put together in groups or clusters. \n",
    "\n",
    "K denotes the number of clusters to be formed. For example k=2 means there will be 2 clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works:\n",
    "- Initially two centroids are assigned randomly.\n",
    "- The Euclidean Distance is used to find out which centroid is closest to each data point and data points are assigned to coresponding centroids.\n",
    "- The process is iteratively repeated until our centroid is actual central point of cluster and becomes static\n",

    "Euclidean distance can be calculated using:\n",
