This repository contains practice projects for various Machine Learning algorithms using Python and popular libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and NumPy.
The goal is to experiment with preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and feature engineering.



Implementations of algorithms including:

Linear Regression

Logistic Regression

Decision Trees

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

Random Forests

Data preprocessing and feature encoding

Train-test splitting and model evaluation

Visualization of results where applicable
