**Machine Learning Algorithm Practice**

This repository contains practice projects for various Machine Learning algorithms using Python and popular libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and NumPy.
The goal is to experiment with preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and feature engineering.



**Implementations of algorithms including:**

- Linear Regression

- Logistic Regression

- Decision Trees

- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

- Random Forests

- Data preprocessing and feature encoding

- Train-test splitting and model evaluation

- Visualization of results where applicable
